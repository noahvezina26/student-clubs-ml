    "### Problem definition:\n",
    "A classification model that provides school club recommendations to students\n",
    "based on past student data aimed to help students better integrate in the school community and improve themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience:\n",
    "* Students can use this to find what they are likely to enjoy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schools can use this to recommend activities to students\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope and constraints:\n",
    "* We will only be analyzing the ten data fields found in our dataset with a focus on making a classification model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Club recommendations will be very general, given the data (e.g. \"Art Club\" or \"Sports Team\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Later, we could implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Language models for more natural/human results\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Bias study by hiding certain data fields and see how it affects results\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * School specific datasets compatibility\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Success criteria:\n",
    "We're going to use a cross-entropy loss function to examine how well our model performs."
