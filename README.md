# Student Club ML Project
This project was made for the Fall 2024 Cohort of the AI Launch Lab Program!
The end goal of this was to recommend students clubs that they're likely to enjoy based on previous student data.

To run this project, it is highly recommended that you clone the repository on your machine then create a virtual environment with all dependencies.
